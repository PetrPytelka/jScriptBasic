# ScriptBasic for Java, The Name

The name of the application officially is "ScriptBasic for Java". The short name is jScriptBasic
or sometimes sb4j. The last one is used usually when the name is used in configuration file, or
at some location where the name jScriptBasic would be too long.

For example the default file name for the configuration file that ScriptBasic uses is `sb4j.properties`. (Note that
ScriptBasic for Java does not need configuration generally though.)

"ScriptBasic" without the starting `j` or without saying that this is for java denotes the
classic version of ScriptBasic. The classic version was developed by the same authors from 1997 till 2006 and was and is still used
by many application as an embedded language. To name two: Sarian routers can be programmed using ScriptBasic and the company
EZ-R Stats uses ScriptBasic to develop audit routines into their application.
  
Sometimes we distinguish that version written in C from the Java version. In such situation we
refer to the C version as ScriptBasic C or ScriptBasic Classic.

Scriba or `scriba` is the name of the executable of the classic version.

## Name usage guide

We recommend that you use the long name <ScriptBasic for Java> when you want to refer to the
language and interpreter in an article, blog or other human readable text.

Use jScriptBasic only if the repetitive use of the long name would distract the reader.

Use `sb4j` when the notation is used in software.
