# Design Considerations
 
 The main design goals of ScriptBasic for Java were to create an interpreted language that is
 
 * BASIC, easy to use

 * free
 
 * supported
 
 * scripting
 
 * portable

 * 4E: easy to embed, easy to extend
 
 * multi-thread

We wanted a BASIC interpreter in Java so that
Java application can access a BASIC interpreter as a scripting extension
to their application to be used by the business experts.
