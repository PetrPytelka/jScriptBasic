/**
 * <p>
 * Keep a registry of methods. The Java methods (either class or object method)
 * can be called from interpreted script. The problem is that Java methods can
 * be overloaded and BASIC functions can not. To overcome this issue the BASIC
 * program has to declare a function name for each method it wants to call. For
 * example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * method sin from java.lang.Math is (double) use as sinus
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Here the method {@code sin} is to be used from the java package
 * {@code java.lang.Math} and the alias is {@code sinus}. The
 * {@code use as sinus} part is optional. If this is missing then the name of
 * the method will be used as the name of the BASIC function and no alias is
 * used. If this part is defined then the alias will be used as the name of the
 * function.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If there are two methods of the same name, with different signature, you have
 * to define different aliases for the different methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the same alias for different methods in different packages. This
 * can be done because the class name or alias for the class name or the
 * variable holding the Java object reference stands in front of the method
 * name/alias when the registered method is called. This distinguishes the
 * different methods of different class even if the aliases or the method names
 * are the same.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Also note that you can also use aliases for Class names defined in the
 * statement {@code use}.
 * </p>
 * The registry keeps track of the
 * <ul>
 * <li>name of the method, Â 
 * <li>the alias,
 * <li>the class and
 * <li>the signature.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Thus whenever there is a function call in BASIC to call a Java method in a
 * certain class this registry will know which signature to use for the certain
 * alias.
 * </p>
 * Aliases can be global or class specific. When an alias is defined for a
 * single method then the alias can be used without the class specification.
 * This appears in the BASIC code as a simple function call. When a method is
 * registered in the MethodRegistry it is registered in the normal registry as
 * well as in the global registry. When registering a method in the global
 * registry the implementation checks if there is already a method registered
 * with that alias. If there is then the alias is not global, can not be used
 * without an object or class reference and it is removed from the global
 * registry.
