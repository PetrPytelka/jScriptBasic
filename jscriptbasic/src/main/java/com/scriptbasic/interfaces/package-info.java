/**
 * This package contains all the interfaces that are implemented in the ScriptBasic library and that are available for the embedding application.
 * Even though there are numerous interfaces only a very small subset is needed to successfully embed a BASIC interpreter into your Java
 * code. The rest is only in case you want to use the package for different purposes, for example you may use the code to analyze
 * text files lexically and implement on the lexeme stream a different syntax analyzer.
