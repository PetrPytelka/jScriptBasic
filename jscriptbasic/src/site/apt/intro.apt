What is ScriptBasic for Java

 ScriptBasic for Java is a scripting implementation of the classic {{{./basic.html}basic}} language.
 Using this interpreter you can extend you application with BASIC scripting possibilities. There are many
 scripting languages that can be embedded into Java application. Different languages have different
 capabilities and different target users' group. ScriptBasic for Java targets the applications that are
 to be extended using scripts by users who are not programmers.
 
* No freak out language 
 
 Business analysts, domain experts who use an application can learn Groovy, JavaScript, Scala or some other
 scripting language. In case of BASIC this learning is not needed. If anything is known by such a user BASIC is.
 This also means that the "freak out" factor is minimal. Your prospective customers may freak out hearing that
 the application can be scripted using Groovy or Scala or JavaScript which all are considered geek languages.
 In case of BASIC this does not happen. If the prospective user has minimal affinity to programming
 he or she has some experience using Excel and its BASIC, Visual Basic or just any other BASIC.
 
 For the same reason the language implemented is very simple. It implements only a very limited set
 of commands and operators. All command is implemented that is needed to create embedded scripts but nothing more.
 You can assign values to variables, loop, execute conditional code (IF statement), print to the standard output
 and call subroutines. These are the internal things to execute a script. To communicate with the embedding application
 more than just printing to the output the program can call Java static methods or instance methods in case an
 object is stored in a BASIC variable. To that he usual <<<object.method(params)>>> format can be used, or just
 <<<method(params)>>> in case of static functions.
 
* Control at the hand of the application

 Script languages many time if not properly configured pose security risks. When you start a script it can
 access the application Java objects, methods and so on. You have to pay great attention to execute other
 language scripts securely setting up SecurityManager.
 
 To execute jScriptBasic all you have to do is to configure the optional RunLimitHook included in the
 interpreter JAR file to limit the execution to your security needs.
 
* Standard Interface

 To embed ScriptBasic for Java into your application you can (and you are suggested to) use the standard
 JSR-223 interface. This way you can embed just any scripting language easily without further programming.
 As a matter of fact the <<<main()>>> method of the class <<<com.scriptbasic.main.CommandLine>>> uses solely
 this interface and as a side effect you can use the command line version of ScriptBasic for Java to execute
 JavaScript files utilizing the JRE7 built in Rhino engine. It is a feature that was not designed by the developers
 of ScriptBasic for Java. It just happens to be a fact that using the JSR-223 interface if the extension of
 the script file is <<<.js>>> then the Rhino interpreter will start.
 
* Command line tool

 You can execute BASIC programs from the command line. All you have to do is issue the command line
 
---
java -jar jscriptbasic.jar basicProgram.sb
---        

 and the program in the file <<<basicProgram.sb>>> will execute.
 
* License is Open Source

 ScriptBasic for Java is licensed with the GPLv3 license. If you need commercial license contact the developers.
 At the early, intial stage of the project expect easy deals for the introductory period.
